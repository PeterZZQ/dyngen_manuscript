	abstract = {Proper execution of transcriptional programs is a key requirement of gene expression regulation, demanding accurate control of timing and amplitude. How precisely the transcription machinery fulfills this task is not known. Using an in situ hybridization approach that detects single mRNA molecules, we measured mRNA abundance and transcriptional activity within single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. We found that expression levels for particular genes are higher than initially reported and can vary substantially among cells. However, variability for most constitutively expressed genes is unexpectedly small. Combining single-transcript measurements with computational modeling indicates that low expression variation is achieved by transcribing genes using single transcription-initiation events that are clearly separated in time, rather than by transcriptional bursts. In contrast, PDR5, a gene regulated by the transcription coactivator complex SAGA, is expressed using transcription bursts, resulting in larger variation. These data directly demonstrate the existence of multiple expression modes used to modulate the transcriptome.},

	abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}SUMMARY{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Non-genetic transcriptional variability at the single-cell level is a potential mechanism for therapy resistance in melanoma. Specifically, rare subpopulations of melanoma cells occupy a transient pre-resistant state characterized by coordinated high expression of several genes. Importantly, these rare cells are able to survive drug treatment and develop resistance. How might these extremely rare states arise and disappear within the population? It is unclear whether the canonical stochastic models of probabilistic transcriptional pulsing can explain this behavior, or if it requires special, hitherto unidentified molecular mechanisms. Here we use mathematical modeling to show that a minimal network comprising of transcriptional bursting and interactions between genes can give rise to rare coordinated high states. We next show that although these states occur across networks of different sizes, they depend strongly on three (out of seven) model parameters and require network connectivity to be {$\leq$} 6. Interestingly, we find that while entry into the rare coordinated high state is initiated by a long transcriptional burst that also triggers entry of other genes, the exit from it occurs through the independent inactivation of individual genes. Finally, our model predicts that increased network connectivity can lead to transcriptionally stable states, which we verify using network inference analysis of experimental data. In sum, we demonstrate that established principles of gene regulation are sufficient to describe this new class of rare cell variability and argue for its general existence in other biological contexts.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
